Task:

- To solve the task, you can modify CSS HTML and add any JS. 
    - Make the element “fade-out” when clicking the close button. Importantly, at the end of the fade-out animation, the element should have a “display: none” style. - DONE
    - Add tooltips with a description when hovering on the close button, chat button, and also center the green button in the yellow area. - DONE
    - Add mobile responsiveness: 
        - Under a certain browser window width threshold (768px or 1024px) change the element size and  position to appear like this: MOBILE LANDSCAPE MODE (notice the element is wider and the font is smaller, make it look good  so that it does not take much space on the screen) - DONE
